                    <p>
                        My love of food was kindled from a young age. I fondly recall
                        hours spent watching my parents cook in the kitchen and yearning
                        for an early taste of what would be served for dinner that day.
                        However, my fascination with cooking was ignited in high school, when I worked
                        as a sushi chef part-time in a local Japanese-American fusion restaurant.
                        From stumbling into the restaurant at 7AM on Saturdays to prepare 50
                        lb of sushi rice to spending the next 7 hours actually preparing the sushi,
                        the experience not only taught me perseverence and discipline, but also cultivated my passion.
                        I would spend the next year and a half honing my skills and learning how to cook a variety of
                        other Asian fusion dishes.
                        <br> <br>
                        Now in college, I no longer enjoy the luxury of a having an industrial kitchen at my disposal, but
                        still enjoy cooking and baking in my free time. For me, it serves as not only a way to practice and further develop my skills,
                        but also as a pastime to enjoy with friends. I occassionally post on my <a href="https://www.instagram.com/chefzeng/" target="_blank">food instagram</a>
                        and intend to use this page as an avenue to post recipes that I've had much success with in the past as well as commentary on
                        what I found to be useful while following them.

            <h3>Dry Aging Meat</h3>
            <p>
                Over the summer of 2018, I tried dry-aging my own NY striploin
                in a secondhand mini-fridge I purchased for $30. After cleaning the fridge,
                I cut the $110 striploin (purchased from a local butchery) in half and
                wrapped it in cheesecloth (to help prevent too much initial moisture loss).
                I set up some racks in the fridge as well as a thermometer (to keep the temperature
                between 35-40F) and a fan (to keep constant air circulation). I dry-aged them for 60
                days and got some pretty neat results, check them out! </p>

            <h3>Watermelon Ice Cream</h3>
            <p>
                I stumbled upon one of those food videos on Facebook where there was watermelon ice cream
                inside of a watermelon slice and tried to make my own. Unfortunately, even the unconventional means
                of trying to make ice cream without an ice cream maker (like the bag of ice and salt technique) didn't
                work too well and I ended up getting a watermelon slushie. It still looked really nice though!

                        <h3>Matcha Macarons</h3>
                        <p>
                            I've made macarons plenty of times before, but they've never come out as good as
                            they did with this recipe. The keys I've found are to avoid overmixing (just until you can
                            make a full figure 8 using the mixture without it breaking) and to let it rest for at least half
                            an hour after tapping the air out of them. At around 15 minutes in the oven, you should start watching the macarons,
                            I took them out at 17 minutes for a softer texture and better colour. As for colouring, always use food gel colouring and make
                            sure you put more than the actual colour you want because it lightens up in the oven.

                        <p>
                            A classic when it comes to Chinese desserts. I didn't have enough when I was younger, so I always fill up
                            on them whenever I come across a Chinese bakery or when I make them at home! I ended up using two recipes,
                            one for the crust (which I found to give a super flakey and amazing crust) and one for the filling. For the crust,
                            make sure you don't let it rest too long overnight (will ruin the air pockets and make it not flakey) and avoid opening
                            the oven too often when baking. For better colour on the crust, I found that egg-washing it and then baking for an extra
                            couple of minutes worked well.

                            very concise and easy to follow. If you're too impatient to wait for the crème brûlées to cool, you can put them in the
                            freezer for 20-30 minutes. Additionally, a mixture of white sugar and dried brown sugar on top was amazing for colour and taste.

                            This is a super simple but delicious dish. Make sure you buy a fresh whole fish for this (and then have the butcher clean and
                            scale it for you). Some tips for choosing good fish is to make sure that its eyes are clear (not cloudy) and that it doesn't
                            have an overwhelmingly fishy smell. If the smells makes you nauseous, then it's most likely not fresh. Also, make sure you have
                            a wok/steamer that's big enough to steam this fish in!

                            This was an incredibly humbling experience since it took ~2 days to make the broth and chashu from scratch and the
                            taste was nowhere near that of some of the better ramen places I've been to. In retrospect, I would've added much
                            umami into it (maybe anchovies, some more MSG or pork fat?). Make sure you keep simmering the bones to get as much
                            broth as possible out of them (even drain it and then fill it with water for a second batch).

                            Tender, flavourful and savoury, this is definitely a childhood favourite of mine! I've found that steaming in a bamboo steamer
                            with some cheesecloth instead of pan-frying them led to a more tender and flakier texture. My family
                            has always made this dish with strips of carrots and sugar snap peas to add more colour, texture and flavour.
